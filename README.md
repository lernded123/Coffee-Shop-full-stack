Full Stack Coffee Shop

## Description

I made a full stack coffee shop website using NodeJs and ejs as the templating language.

I wanted to expand upon my previous cofee shop web designs and add in a database and server.


## Roadmap

I'm currently planning on adding in a logout/login feature, its in my code I just need to link it to the frontend and finish some routes.

I'm also planning on adding in a cart to be able to add items like coffee items.

The final part will likely be to add in a booking feature at the end as well as an about section.
